The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern greatly helped us in organizing the code for the Electronic Device project. Hereâ€™s how it contributed to a well-structured and maintainable codebase:

Separation of Responsibilities:

The MVC pattern divided the application into three distinct components:

Model: Represented the core logic and data for electronic devices, such as ElectronicDevice and its subclasses like SmartPhone, GamingConsole, and SmartSpeaker.

View: Handled the display of information to the user through the ConsoleView class.

Controller: Managed user input and coordinated updates between the Model and View using the DeviceController class.

This clear separation ensured that each part of the code focused on its specific role, reducing complexity and improving readability.

Reusability:

The Model components (e.g., ElectronicDevice and its subclasses) were designed independently of the View and Controller. This modularity allowed the same classes to be reused in other projects or with different user interfaces without modification.

For example, the SmartPhone class could be reused in a GUI application without any changes to its logic.

Ease of Maintenance:

Changes in one component did not require significant changes in others. For instance:

If we wanted to modify how device information was displayed, we only needed to update the ConsoleView class.

Adding new device types (e.g., a Tablet class) only required changes in the Model and minimal updates to the Controller.

This modularity made debugging and maintaining the code much simpler.

Enhanced Testability:

By isolating the Model from the View, we were able to test the core logic of the ElectronicDevice and its subclasses independently.

Similarly, the DeviceController could be tested to ensure it properly updated the View and Model without being influenced by how the data was displayed.

Scalability:

The MVC structure made the code scalable. For example:

Adding new features, such as sorting devices by price or filtering by type, could be implemented with minimal changes to the existing components.

A graphical user interface (GUI) could replace the ConsoleView without altering the underlying logic in the Model and Controller.

Readability and Collaboration:

The structured organization allowed different team members to work on specific components independently. One team member could focus on the DeviceController, while another worked on the ConsoleView, and yet another extended the ElectronicDevice hierarchy.

This separation minimized conflicts and made the codebase easier to navigate for all contributors.

In conclusion, adopting the MVC pattern in the Electronic Device project provided a clear and structured approach to organizing the code. It ensured better modularity, improved testability, and made the project scalable and easier to maintain. The pattern's ability to separate concerns played a key role in achieving a clean and efficient design for our application.
